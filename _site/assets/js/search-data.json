Anyone can access them freely. #open-science Get started now View it on GitHub Getting started Software requirements Dejournal is a browser application that runs on your computer. It interacts directly with Ethereum blockchain and Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS). For communication with Ethereum blockchain you will need to install Metamask wallet and a compatible browser. After you install the Metamask extension in your browser, create a new wallet and securely store the seed phrase. Fund your wallet Dejournal runs on Rinkeby Ethereum testnet. You can get free ether on Metamask faucet. Set Metamask to Rinkeby network. Go to Metamask faucet and request free ether. Wait until ether shows in your Metamask wallet. Publish on Dejournal Select Rinkeby network in your Metamask wallet. Open dejournal-39b67.firebaseapp.com in your browser. Select Publish in the top navigation bar. Enter the Title, Authors, Abstract and upload the document. Then click Submit. A Metamask pop-up will show up asking you to confirm the transaction. Click Confirm. The publication cost and transaction fee will be deducted from your Ethereum wallet. Go to Dejournal Home and your publication should be listed among last 5 publications.

    "title": "Roadmap",
    "content": "Roadmap of Dejournal Platform prototype (July 2019) The platform currently runs on Rinkeby testnet. It allows three main features: Publishing of papers Querying papers by ID number Listing last 5 publications Listing of all submissions is not implemented through the web application due to a large amount of data that needs to be processed. This can be done by directly querying the smart contract. Searching is not available due to the limitations of the smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. A separate indexing and search engine platform will be implemented to solve this. Indexing and search engine (Jan 2020) This will be a centralized application that will index all the papers on Dejournal. It will allow searching by keywords. You can think of it as Google for Dejournal. Peer review module (July 2020) The central part of scientific publishing is peer review. It is a quality control system that helps maintain high quality of papers. Currently this is done by individual journals and is a closed process. Only few journals publish reviews publicly. Dejournal will implement an open peer review system. The DAO will define the rules to qualify the reviewers. An author of a paper could also pay a reward for reviewers at the time of submission and define how to split it. Data replication system In theory, anyone could find the hashes of all Dejournal files stored on IPFS and replicate them. We want to simplify this by making data replication straight-forward and simple. The next step is to set up a rewards system for nodes that register as data replicators.",

    "content": "Structure of the platform IPFS node Each submission on Dejournal generates two files that are stored on IPFS nodes. The first file that is uploaded is the file containing the manuscript, usually a PDF. The IPFS identifier of this file is then returned to the Dejournal app and stored in a metadata JSON text file. Besides the manuscript file identifier, this JSON contains also data, such as title, authors and abstract. This is the second file that is uploaded to the IPFS node and the identifier of this file is then stored on Ethereum blockchain. Smart contract The Dejournal smart contract stores the IPFS identifiers of JSON files with metadata and manuscript IPFS identifiers. Besides the identifier it also stores the public key of the wallet that submitted the paper and a timestamp. The smart contract is developed with Truffle framework. Web application The user interface of Dejournal is a Web application binding together all of these parts. Here are some basic information about the app: Programming language: JavaScript Framework: ReactJS UI library: Bootstrap 4 Ethereum blockchain library: web3.js IPFS library: ipfs-mini.js",

    "title": "What is Dejournal?",
    "content": "What is Dejournal? Dejournal is a decentralized application for publishing scientific pre-prints on Ethereum blockchain and IPFS. Dejournal addresses the current challenges in scientific publishing. Most scientific papers are locked behind paywalls. Many scientists cannot afford to pay expensive subscriptions and are therefore not updated about the latest scientific findings. This prevents them to contribute equally to the scientific community. Papers published on Dejournal will be always freely available. Scientific papers are published in journals, which can define their own policies and quality standards. This gave rise to many predatory journals who charge high publication fees to publish bad quality papers. Dejournal works differently. Anything can be published on Dejournal. The community decides on the quality through our peer-review system. Publishing in a scientific journal requires you to give away your copyrights to the journal. All materials published on Dejournal are copyrighted by their authors. Scientific journals are businesses. Scientists cannot influence the business decissions. Dejournal is an organization run by the community. We are open to everyone willing to contribute. Features Decentralized application Dejournal is a decentralized application. This means it doesnâ€™t rely on servers in data warehouse. Instead, it runs directly from your browser. A typical journal stores scientific papers on their own servers. If they shut the servers down, noone can access the scientific papers they host. Dejournal, instead, hosts papers on Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS). IPFS is a network of computers (nodes) that replicate the data from other nodes. You can set up your own node and help us replicate the Dejournal data. In the future, nodes that replicate (pin) Dejournal data will be also financially rewarded. Notarization of paper submission Paper stored on IPFS can be accessed by a unique identifier (hash). This is an immutable identifier and guaranties that the file has not been changed. This identifier is also written to Ethereum blockchain. When you add an entry to Ethereum blockchain it is carved in stone unless a digital apocalypse happens. This also means that your submission is notarized - you can prove that you submitted a paper at a certain time. All you need is your Metamask wallet (keep your private keys and seed phrases safe!). Open source The code of Dejournal platform is hosted on Github. You can inspect the code that it does what it says. It also means that anyone can contribute to the project. Dejournal is a community-driven initiative. Democratic The central part of Dejournal will be a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). A member can become anyone who is interested in the future of Dejournal and open science. Membership will be awarded to anyone contributing money or time. DAO will be funded by publication fees and by member contributions. A member can suggest Dejournal improvement proposals. An improvement proposal who passes a majority vote will be awarded a grant.",
