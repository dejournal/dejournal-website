## Getting started

### Software requirements

Dejournal is a browser application that runs on your computer. It interacts directly with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain and Interplanetary Filesystem ([IPFS](https://ipfs.io)). For communication with Ethereum blockchain you will need to install [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io) and a compatible browser. 

After you install the Metamask extension in your browser, create a new wallet and securely store the seed phrase.

### Fund your wallet

Dejournal runs on Rinkeby Ethereum testnet. You can get free ether on Metamask faucet. 
1. Set Metamask to Rinkeby network.
1. Go to [Metamask faucet](https://faucet.metamask.io) and request free ether.
1. Wait until ether shows in your Metamask wallet.

### Publish on Dejournal

1. Select Rinkeby network in your Metamask wallet.
1. Open [dejournal-39b67.firebaseapp.com](dejournal-39b67.firebaseapp.com) in your browser. 
1. Select Publish in the top navigation bar.
1. Enter the Title, Authors, Abstract and upload the document. Then click Submit.
1. A Metamask pop-up will show up asking you to confirm the transaction. Click Confirm. The publication cost and transaction fee will be deducted from your Ethereum wallet.
